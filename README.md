# BrainfuckCompiler
In this repo I am making an Universal Brainfuck Compiler Using just Java.

To use this compiler, go to your c drive 
then to "Program Files",then 
to "Java", then to your jdk folder, then 
copy the "bin" and "lib" folders into a single folder named "jre" and then 
place the exe file in the jre folder and use it.

The .exe file wont work without the folders....

Hope you like it.... :)
