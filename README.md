# Brainfuck Interpreter Using Java
In this repo I am making an Universal Brainfuck Interpreter Using just Java.

To use this Interpreter, go to your c drive 
then to "Program Files",then 
to "Java", then to your jdk folder, then 
copy the "bin" and "lib" folders into a single folder named "jre" and then 
place the exe file in the folder containing the jre folder and use it.

The exe file in the drive link.

The .exe file wont work without the folders....

Or else you can just download everything from the zip file from the following Google Drive Link :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16I6-T2HtdJbc5igOU73lLbGu_3bh2hBo?usp=sharing
if you download it from here then after downloading open the folder right click on the exe file and go to properties.
After that go to the security heading and check the Unblock button. This will allow Windows to run the app.
Oterwise you won't be able to run the app, as windows will think the app is harmful and will try to make you not open it.

Hope you like it.... :)
