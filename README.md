# BrainfuckCompiler
In this repo I am making an Universal Brainfuck Compiler Using just Java.

To use this compiler, go to your c drive 
then to "Program Files",then 
to "Java", then to your jdk folder, then 
copy the "bin" and "lib" folders into a single folder named "jre" and then 
place the exe file in the jre folder and use it.

The .exe file wont work without the folders....

Or else you can just download everything from the following Google Drive Link :

Hope you like it.... :)
